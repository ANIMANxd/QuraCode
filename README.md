QuraCode is a lightweight, dependency-free web application for generating QR codes. Built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a fast and secure way for users to create QR codes directly in their browser. As all processing is handled client-side, no user data is ever transmitted to a server.
